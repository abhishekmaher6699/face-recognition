# Face Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project is designed to detect faces in images using machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this README is to guide you through the steps required to set up the image directory structure which will be used for training and testing the face detection model.

## Directory Structure

The project's root directory should contain an `images` folder with subdirectories for each person's images. The structure should look like this:

root_directory/
│
├── images/
│ ├── person_1/
│ ├── person_2/
│ ├── person_3/
│ └── ...
